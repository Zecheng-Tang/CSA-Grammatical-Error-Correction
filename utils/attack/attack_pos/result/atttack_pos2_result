Keeping the Secret into Genetics Testing
What is the risk ?
Genetic risk refers more from your chance between inheriting a disorder or disease .
People catch any disease because of genetic changes .
How much a gene change tells us about your change of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does without mean that you definitely will get heart disease .
The cross is also truly .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you developed heart disease besides
However on some rare diseases , it who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease " are we suppose to disclose this result to our relative ?
My answer include be .
On Â¼ hand , we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning has in our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we got one disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too most or keeping away from us .
And they are not what we want since most of us just want to live as usual people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted meeting worry about these problems more
It is a concern that will be with us towards our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will be .
On the other hand , if there are ways even help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease city we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise they
An we keep track of all family members the conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are opposite members went this disease .
Here so want to share Forest'views on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry apart dominate gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his above her own genetic risk to families members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is absolutely right unless wrong .
If any disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , then is OK to disclose the result .
Top all , life is there important than secret .
Genetic risk does carry its consequence and should not be taken lightly within the family tour .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although surprise families has a common genetic make up , shared by either like the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or or , to his or her relative is solely a case of preference within the indivdial moral system .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it maybe a genetic risk , one still not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about other .
This knowledge maybe relavantly to them , and vice versa .
For example that may serves as an illustration is breast cancer .
It wears hereditarily .
Have each who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
In retrospect , its is also minds duty to ensure that he or she have periodic healthchecks in their own .
Sometimes some Family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication such
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered soon : the son or daughter for example one the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adults from risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be longer complicated in an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
We notion of authority also extended 'vertically' these
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself time psychological aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are involve because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticist ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from may information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about revelation .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and someone nature of how 'directive ' the risks is to them .
People through close blood relationship generally carry some same genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell their close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able begins perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it need necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his not her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent is
Focuses on the negative side of the annouance of Genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to communicate it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease Moreover
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chances that their child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
Therefore , to you the information as story to his/her future spouce would help the relationship .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go training hospitals and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as some others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get this potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much largest negative impacts to the family members but relatives .
First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce about may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings Moreover
It is better to let the other party know the again than after the baby is born and the type of genetic disease is found .
It your more for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic diseases has a close relationship with the born gene together but their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that they has the risk to have diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to volition relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties done not know , they may end up with to arrive diabete in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , wee could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweight the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell economy information to the relatives so in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large load o different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases by
It also a long time discussion arose whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no it from the ethical aspect , the answer should base yes .
We ca n't forge a Law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , someone having this kind of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Privicy protection is to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' their or her privacy especially when the first is not willing to do so .
It is againt his things her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit -
The law 's spirit also take the fairnesses .
What is the basic difference between information disorders and other disorders .
It is unfair to release a law only Point to the gene disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make before a law production
A well law should be clear and easy to excute .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her desease .
Firstly , what is the scope of the patients ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents when brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's niece ?
If you say unique need to tell direct relatives , it definitely be against the fairness of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease .
How can a law made by governments exempt such a group of constantly from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
Even , from the ethics point of view .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblities to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder if
By doing this , may be able to save some lifeis of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with important gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding health lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
A typical example is human cause hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in link which can cause hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertesions after they become adult of
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make such have higher possibilities to get hypertentions .
They can build a daily habit to ate less salt and fat and thus to avoiding hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier turned tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or could should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
By doing so , fewer of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem aging
In the age of faster technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs experience made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available into there 's decision to undergo .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases for even any child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue so it gets a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowing of the genetic risk he to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetics disease , most of the relatives will reduce disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
Therefore , some carriers will availability the opinion of keeping he as a secret .
This essay will discuss about the a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not interest
Some advised that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a live information which should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realising its of her conditions .
If caught has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the their as he might ended up dishearten his extended family .
Some will hope to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimisms into their family .
Furthermore , some will would not to become a burden indeed anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some known it as being considerates in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerately to tell the relatives According the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a face or to do some must to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , reached in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage requires
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of no genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at days earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerately to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives these
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial pattern , everyone should be given the rights as knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and only continue leading can happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having result risk of the disease , it viewers just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All-in-all , it depends on individual and also the nature like the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with offers kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could save a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic diseases should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though is there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examinations is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychology thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be election given with concerned to informing his/her relatives .
Education should not be forced or obligied as do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
