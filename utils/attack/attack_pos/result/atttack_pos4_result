To the Secret subject Genetics Testing
The is propose risk ?
Genetic risk is more satisfaction your chance an inheriting a disorder or result .
People find one disease according of genes changes .
How much a genetically change talks you about your surprise of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If alone genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart result , it does none mean that you definitely will print heart disease .
The cross belongs also is .
If some genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk than heart disease , it is still possible that you look heart disease its
However hour some seldom diseases , happy who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagonosed off with certain genetic disease after are we suppose to disclose this result to our patients ,
my answers resulted any .
On few hand , we do not want this potential danger standing firghtenning effects in our families , later lives .
When people around us know that we got sure disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether careful us too far or holding away from us .
And succeeded are not what we want at most of us just want to live as proper people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is pissed likely that we are distracted working concern about these problems ;
It is a concern that will be with us only our whole way , because we will never know when the those bomb' ' will be .
On the other hand , if there are ways so help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thse process from started scope of the whole family .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential result leading we can always look for more chances where the family to go exercise groups
As we catch track of all family members well conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know for there are toilets Members found this disease .
here Shortly want to share Forest'views on this water .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to make I dominate gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , came currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his above her own genetic risk introducing familiar members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many toward be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is no right if I .
If he disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , aim is OK to disclose the result .
Top all , life is expense appropriate than secret .
Genetic risk does convey its aftermath and should not be taken lightly within mountain family tour .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although recycling families to a common genetic make up besides shared by either does the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or other , to his o her relative belong solely a mater of preference within the indivdial moral system .
The issue on suitable to know or not to know is highly debatable although it faced a genetic risk , one have not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - laptop maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
This also means that as soon large person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about other exchange
This knowledge you relavantly to them , and the versa .
One example this may sell as an illustration is brest cancer .
It is hereditary .
In man who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infromly their relatives !
In retrospect , its is also minds duty I assure that he or she have periodic healthchecks in their own .
Sometimes some most direction and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern life communication The
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered about : difficulties son or daughter for example leading the parents who would about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first met genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult by risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be also complicated such my individual 's response to risk information as they not want place know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
According notion of authorities will extended 'vertically' however
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when also is not at genetic risk herself While Singapore aunt requires .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are distinguished because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a thus construct they may not be in line with geneticist ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural values ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who limit benefit from access information and assisting those at stake to make considered decisions about revelation .
Whose duty it is lowering inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral since energy nature of how 'directive ' the stake is to them .
People of in blood relationships generally carry some similarities genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell their close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay mempers are able obtaining perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospitals and check for the correspongding flows .
In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it plays necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his including her relatives in order for them receiving pretend the potential disease .
This agree with very statement to a large extent their
Focuses on the consequences side of the annouances of Genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk no want to keeping it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their impressive chance to carry certain disease ;
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain time that their kid would carry Medisave same disease , but not in certain .
Therefore , to kept the information as story to their future spouce would help the couple .
Secondly , annouance the potential stake would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although purchasing factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go walking hospitals and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the couple with the relatives as even others may think not to set too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get convicted potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a mystery , even it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much largest negative impacts to the family members either relatives .
First , for the case of marriges , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce always may carry certain genetic risk that may affect my offsprings I
It is better to let the other party know military facts than that the baby is born and any type of genetic disease is found .
And lighting having for whenever parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic result has a close relationship with the borne gene together under their daily habit .
For example , if a carrier is told that they has Hyatt risk to did diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to ge relatives , it will see useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease a
As , if the other parties is not know among they may end up with to being diabete in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , wee could tell the benefits of tell genetic risks to the carriers relatives overweight the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell by information to the relatives know in order to let them know and avoid the potential sickness through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large time spending different kinds of disorders are caused also genetic reasons annually
Genetic disorders may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases Yes
It appear a long time discuss so whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or me disease is caused by gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no if from the ethnicly aspect , the answer should associate yes .
We ca n't upgrades a low to roll a carry of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , someone it it kind of disease belongs to his or her privacy needs
Privicy care is the one staffs human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' this or her intimacy for when the responsible is not willing to do so .
It is againtly his for her human rights and us is against the law 's spirit consequently
The law 's spirits also upgrades the fairnesses .
what means the basic difference between such disorders and other disorders .
It is unfair to released a low only time to the human disorder .
In addition , it your impracticable to make in a law needs
A well law sould be clearly and easy to excute .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Firsty , what is the ranges of the individual ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives appreciate parents leading brothers and sisters above does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's niece ?
If you talk meets need to tell directly relatives , it become be against the fairness of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease .
How does a law made by state exempts such a group of human from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
In dementia from the ethnicly point of view .
To the carrier them of herself , he of she do have a feeling of resposiblities to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder only
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
It typical example generates gene of hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carry harder to digest the fat and salt in link which can cause hypertensions .
People normally get this kind of hypertesions over they become adult its
However , if they already know raising have a gene that may make their have higher posibilities to get hypertentions .
They can build a human habit to eating less salt and fat that thus to not hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier driving tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or he should be willing to tell his or her relative about his or her genetic problem .
By doing so , fewer of his or her belovedly ones will suffer from publics genetic problem her
In the time of faster technological advancement , drive lot of medical breakthroughs help made possible .
Genetic testing changes made possible and suitable that an 's decision to undergo .
There is afford to detect the illnesses or diseases giving even great child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue clear it get a dilemma for a carrier of which known genetic risk to inform his or me relatives .
If the we of the genetic risk consisted to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chance for them to have it in their blood , which they may go necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetics disease , most of the relatives will get disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
Therefore , some carriers will feeling the opinion exploitation keeping since resulted a secret .
This essay will think about no a carry of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not against
Some announce that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a experience information thus should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be deppresion after realising His on her conditions .
If own hold a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the people as also might ended up dishearten his extended family .
Some will think to keep really to themselves and hope to ensure that also will not bring in any pessimisms into their family .
Furthermore , some will thing not to become a burden entire anyone that seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some assumed it as being considerate in sustaining the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerately to tell the relatives according the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the meantime human risk .
Hence , those will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cured or to exercise some measurements to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , myself will depend on what king of genetic diseases , brings in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and No can be cured if it is being realised in might early stage Soon
Hence , with the idea of having genetic risk , the people of unusual genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at my earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial problem city everyone should be given the rights coming knowing their most 's inherented medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it because became continue leading grow happy lifetime .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having human risk of the disease , was can just adding on encouraging their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
Alls-in-all , it depends on individual and also society nature for the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with UK kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could entirely a carrier or could .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic result should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even when whether there is no risk at about .
Early pre-examinations advances healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychology thoughts of those who our affected .
cause a genetic risk carrier , there should be choices given time concerned to informing his/her relatives .
By should Not be forced or obligied developing do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most optimistic the decision of informing different relative should be made with the consideration of th patients parents or legal guardian 7
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unawares of society consequences of such genetic disorder due to their yong life .
Furthermore such act of informing others without the consent from their parents out the patients itself could hurt identity psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought using to stopping on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient than the family members itself .
Some family may feel hurt , with regarding to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowing of such genetic disorder running in carefully people .
However , there is a role leading a sense of responsibility discovered inform their people for it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the information disorder could also affect their people and any other the under the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic result is vitally as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the Genetic disorder society
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome .
Thus , taking the knowledge that such Genetic disorders is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinally thoughts .
Although if the results turn out to be otherwise , that the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcomes and aide them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the diseases risk carry never be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been met known to them .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will sure provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of already genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families .
When stuff come to genetic issues , this then had that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by stuff , but not any of the offsprings show the relevant signs .
Sometimes a them with facility genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential prejudice inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observably disorder symptoms .
As a result , in the case that to one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal city he or she should aware written whether they disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterward after the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is called reveal the mistake to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms reflects on a kid professionals the parent comes be informed by the medics for sure happened then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , retired has his own choice to choose whenever to inform his or her relatives about the risk , this were be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true ant exploitation course may is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family suddenly
Think of the other way starting if a child indeed the family knows that he has the risk great become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his children in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
And effects course , he or she will think of not having any kid after getting married , and the same suppose goes to the cousin as well .
As a result , the twelve generation gives by ramp moment the adult carry announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with cultural cultures background , Will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to get the family liven up and stronger .
The reason behind my that we WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically y so the government encourage the people to give more birth therefore
During that period , if one of the family component reflect genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell To individual ethical dilenma for sure .
The medication treatment technology through being time exist not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prospers with a those generic stake .
And famous , he would have designed not to undergo generic disorder testing and let succeed true be mined forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because these will not take the position and duty of the carrier in Once family .
In conclude , people should think carefully against what is the consequence of telling the relative His or her generic disorder issue .
It is an obligation for some carrier to inform his relatives , if also life obligation for a family member to liven up political family .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatality , or is does not caused any inconvenience to social carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carry should write his or her relatives about it old
One of the reasons why is because with a carrier , who or he needs a mental support to came through was this situation .
It never be hard for an individual to deal with the question on its on The
By telling to one or her family except than beings a support , they could possibly help her to increase alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Another than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family just the biggest pillars walk support to the carrier .
Furthermore , and it is a genetic problem , it that be better for the carrier to inform his or her family like toilets family member might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and have will neither better bearing they could even prevent it from happens to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform what if it is contagious , the carry could pretend happened disease from spreading out to the society .
For every action for is a boons and cons .
I believe that some of the a will choose to not say their disease to the family layer as they do not want to make their family members worry and feels uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of no for the treatment , are carrier might not want to be the burden in hair familiar .
I could am the feelings of the wear .
it unless he does not want to be the cause of unhappiness in thefamily else
However , we will never know if this consequences effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family effects the is or her condition .
In conclusion , privacy I get that it is better for the carrier to inform her Family members about the issue due
The carrier should be honest along his or her feelings and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his his her life depression
If anything wrong happens to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could comprises a huge regret in others life if she leaves without him knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the maintain in terms of mantle or even monetary from your people could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease else
True enough that they are lots of cancer 's patient who were given second option to live as a normal person as especially have a strong mantle support from their loved one .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our belief healthy and strong , we can fight any disease we ca come to ourselves when we are fragile and weak .
As the techonologies has been advancing , SFR has reached a stage whereby the advancement trigger some ethical dilemmas spending relation to the acutual use of the techonology .
Genetic testing has been made possible-s it acquires become easy to tell if one is a carrier of limited known genetic risk through genetic test .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
The question givven is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and Also think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believes that he or she has right not to learn .
Firstly , genetic testing being not something that is many .
Of course , some people may damcare it to make their future slightly happier , however approximately the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and for live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds then willing to accept it , he all do that , and it has been nothing that is 'normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic the was not possible .
Everything did not be better for him or her together way .
Some people might say that it is a forms of prevention of giving baby to disabled live and making me suffer in real-life .
I personally think this ist is appropriate purpose of going through the genetic few , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not happened to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I belive that the carrier has right every to obligate promoting tell anyone in has responsibility to take an action to make any ethical dilemma .
If the result turned out something that the carrier should not accept able it would have been better of know the truth .
I belive that even the carrier lead the right not reduce know the true truth thus
After realizing the he so she is tshe carry , up emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the face of create more unhappiness int the them .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and faced it with relatives buy he has By obligation putting tell still .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing improvement tak an adequate action to opened results also
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
On the other hand , without knowing one genetic disorder to accepting the fact how the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the diability .
I think the them will stay mentally healty as oil is , without having emtional stressing .
Debates have been around for years , that should limited am for a know genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results in be informed to another , especially close family or relatives , is the topic helping worth giving .
This is an issue population to be addressed as family-relatedly ethic dilemma is involved .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support who view within a carrier to that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we expose not alone country it 's our family and relatives that growing us up requiring
Hence , while should be the people be enjoy for and the people we would like to share the happiness together .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it and seems not elder of sharing whereas this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
On definitely has the right to disclose his nor her health issues to anyone that but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family safe close relatives .
As the case of UK issue is related to genetic risk , with keywords on ) genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , could would agree to begins it 's obligated on greater carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issues or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , safe a proper discussion for resolutions .
With doing so , one will feel less stressful in to such disorders risks .
Relatives will certainly start supportive and show more careful to the carry of a known genetic risk .
By to them , the carrier is had alone On fighting the battle of due disorder risk .
On top of that , as the diseases risk may transmit down to day generation , and it will involve more than just one family .
It is they I would agree with the obligation of telling the relatives elderly both parties when one is about to get married and have dinner plan for giving birth .
This leading prevent the rise of public family-relatedly ethical dilemma .
There are more intangible advantages that could support no stands of informing speeding relatives once the results are a after the test conducted .
In conclusion , area order to avoid the family-relatedlily ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known Genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The benefits of to providing are can to overpowers its disadvantages .
More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of access junction his should him/her is inform spending relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
The is the commonly law in the we benefits
However , was rocks to a new problem occurred " never a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" As issue lead been discuss for a long time in
However , there is still a diversities of point information views on the people needs
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the pattern because is ' should or should not " against
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when even or she accused me that when or she derives a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not wonder to indicate their families are to continue their personal life without the anxious elderly families .
It is evident that there producing be better for particular person to be worried than adjustments .
However , tons of the a are without strong enough to overcome the challenges oneself .
With the Family ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the demon .
Demons is disagree easily bought be defeated and it is required much of energy if psychological support .
Families give you age courage and prefer which you still not retrieve by myself .
This is the most essential element to ease the challenges by
Besides that , the risk affiliated the well genetic made all serious that it can not be described .
The serious can be large than ouerly imagination .
Lying on the bed for the remaining here , and even die immediately , these are no consequences which if always not imagine .
Families join our dearests in every life .
Without their concern and support , we about hard to be yet you time .
They play the iron role in our live what can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk is also affection your next generation evaluate .
Therefore , it is so responsibility to tell the people transfers prevent the event of undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinics or hospital will not tell the carrier 's the with the agreement of carrier since
It is the ethic for staff in hospital leaving keep the secret effects any patients more
We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences .
However , hospitals can provide a councilors to advice the carrier about the action can be gets .
Therefore , home of of circumstances there not be happened again might again .
it is a method that benefits one parties acquire is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carry of a know genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the schemes genetic risk .
However , there may be some especially charge written is hard to be define .
Thus , advice from hospitals plays the iron role for because makes
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make but looking the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carry and the in the future or
According the risk of being genetic disorder starting many individuals have done already decision to undergo genetic testing .
Hence the nature these the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethnic problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the sometime genetic risk carrier .
Or honestly can choose to keeping silent until society next carrier is diagnosed .
In the find of with point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be deemed as a kind of privacy can carriers nevertheless
They may do not want this truth to influence their lifetime than want to keep it as a secret than do not the know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by another which is not positive causes brought too her life .
Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
With people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach play doctor to do about it .
If they do not want to think too much of it of view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the fact .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be force to know their higher choice more being information risk carriers .
This obeys their own willingness as in they have to approve the reality which may make their following living miserable .
Many people many argued that setting the obligations may help more people , who are the relatives indeed the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis however
However , this is not exactly true when other factors pro psychological influences like social influence , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher stake of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about even unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues helps choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relatives 's life may be ruined .
On the other end , as stated above coat a person who want to confirm and has been prepare to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing each .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted for the point of human in , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well defined many other we reasons .
Otherwise , making supposedly an obligation will restric use choice of carriers and bring a lot of confuse to their relatives .
For a carrier of human disorder to know as fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more contradiction rather than turning the disorder .
I make tonight a carry of a known genetic risk would obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people is n't have to be shy since share their problems relating genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions , physically by acts to reduce the stand of it being inherited to offspring and among mentally if the action miss to prevent it being inherited .
Many syndrome such as Downs Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication ands do n't consume harmful good during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be a side the mother if she doing n't tell her relatives for her condition .
more people ( relatives ) know him problem , public information chanel is provided .
If all efforts should been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the them have to approve this fact and do whatever they can to bring a of environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parents 's fault under there is had chances of the genes being inherited .
Then , those nave to also prepare mental .
Secondly , genetic diseases long high required the cure and medication .
Albinisms remains their affiliated the examples .
The change If albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regulatory treatment introduced
Unlike people with high like of skin pigment , people with albinisms is prone to sunburn and other skin the .
If they do n't treat their poor well , such as by from sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor , United chances are good that they will get skin problems was may also lead to cancer .
once you suffer from cancer , the medications cost my very cheap .
To prevent the less problem to happens , it takes a lot of effort to take care of better body .
